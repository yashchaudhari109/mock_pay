üèóÔ∏è Architecture and Technical Details

This project was built with a strong emphasis on a robust and maintainable architecture, even for a single-screen application.
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): The app is structured using the MVVM pattern to ensure a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase organized and easy to manage.[1]
BLoC (Business Logic Component): The BLoC pattern is employed for state management, ensuring that the UI updates reactively and efficiently to any data changes.
Repository Pattern: Mock data is provided through a repository, which abstracts the data source. This design choice makes it incredibly simple to switch to a real backend API in the future without altering the UI or business logic.
Clean Code Practices: The codebase is organized with related files grouped together and a focus on creating reusable widgets to maintain a tidy and efficient structure.
